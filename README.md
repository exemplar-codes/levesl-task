Task:
Build a React Native app that:

- Displays a list of countries along with a high-level overview of each country using the API from https://restcountries.com/ to fetch country information.
- Includes an input field. As a user types in this field, the list should update to display only the countries whose names match the input. For example, typing 'Al' should filter the list to show "Albania" and "Algeria" along with their respective details.
- You are encouraged to add any additional features or enhancements as you deem appropriate.

We'll be assessing both your code quality and your sense of design. You are welcome to use any third-party libraries. Please document any potential enhancements or changes that you think would improve the app but did not have the time to implement.

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
